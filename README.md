## Business Problem

One of the most important problems in e-commerce is the correct calculation of the points given to the products after sales. The solution to this problem means providing greater customer satisfaction for the e-commerce site, prominence of the product for the sellers and a seamless shopping experience for the buyers. Another problem is the correct ordering of the comments given to the products. The prominence of misleading comments will cause both financial loss and loss of customers. In the solution of these 2 basic problems, while the e-commerce site and the sellers will increase their sales, the customers will complete the purchasing journey without any problems.
